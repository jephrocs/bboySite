<blockquote> The 540 kick is a tornado kick landed on the kicking leg. You jump, kick, and land all on the same leg. The
    average novice can learn this trick within a one to four month time span. Start by drilling inside crescent kicks
    and tornado kicks. Increase your flexibility. Experiment with the takeoff and kick style (roundhouse or inside
    crescent). Watch 540 video clips and emulate what you see. Progress into trying to land the 540 while keeping your
    kicking leg bent (bent knee 540 kick). Train both the tornado kick and bent knee 540 until you succeed. Donâ€™t give
    up
